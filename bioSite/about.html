                Junius Jones is a man from humble beginnings. He was born in a Naval hospital in Orlando, 
                Florida to a father in the Navy and an evangelist mother. His childhood was one of a constantly 
                shifting background. Living his early life in several locations, Junius had to learn to acclimate 
                to new situations and to relate to people of many backgrounds.

                Soon after his birth, his family relocated to Norfolk, Virginia. He later moved, again, to northern Indiana. His family made a home 
                in Gary, Indiana. Next, he would find himself in Hobart, Indiana, where he spent his middle school 
                years. Eventually, he and his family made their way to Newburgh, Indiana, where Junius attended 
                Castle High School, starting a music group called TJB with his friends and siblings.

                He wanted to go to college, but he knew that the cost could be substantial, even crippling. 
                Because of this, he made the decision to join the military, enlisting in the National Guard. While 
                in the military, he spent his time attending school at the University of Southern Indiana, working, 
                and teaching himself new skills.

            <br>    
                He learned to, build cheap computers, donating them to underprivileged youth, to create websites, and to play the guitar, which fueled his love for song writing. After the 
                completion of his enlistment in the National Guard, Junius graduated from college, finishing his degree 
                in Finance. He married his wife, Ashley, who challenges him to try new things, including travel, which 
                became something he loved. They traveled to San Juan in Puerto Rico, Saint Augustine in Florida, and 
                to his current favorite location, Niagara Falls.

                He decided that his education was not finished, and he opted to attend graduate school to gain his MBA 
                in Data Analytics. He went on to work for Macy&#39;s as an Offshore Administrator, where his 
                accomplishments included raising collected outstanding accounts receivable by 50% or approximately 
                5 million dollars in his first year. 
            <br>
            <br>
                He later left Macy&#39;s for new opportunities, first for Honeywell 
                Aerospace as a Program Planning and Control Analyst, then for his current role at Walt Disney World as
                a Senior Financial Systems Analyst. His goals for the future include opening a restaurant and climbing 
                his way into a position that would allow his to influence technological improvement in developing 
                nations. Junius lives in the suburbs of Tampa with his wife, Ashley, and their two cats, Chester and 
                Groot.
